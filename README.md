# Harvey-Bell - 17 - currently studying Computer Science, Maths & Economics
This repository is a portfolio of my projects and contributions as well as my skills in computer science 

I aspire to work within the fintech industry, sectors which appeal to me include investing, financial advisory and using AI within finance.

I have GCSE knowledge of Python aswell as learning C and Java at A level, in class we have also learnt about HTML aswell as using SQL.

Projects at the moment include an "stock managment simulator" which i am developing to pull from APIs so users can manage stocks close to real time. I am also in the process of devoloping a retro style game based on the mobile game doodlejump.
